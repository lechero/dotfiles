Workflow Composer Platform PRD
==============================

Overview
--------
Design a declarative workflow composer that lets teams author reusable pipelines combining Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI, and Cloud CLI steps. The platform interprets YAML manifests describing triggers, routing rules, and post-processing actions, enabling repeatable agent-driven workflows without manual coordination.

Problem Statement
-----------------
- Developers often run the same sequence of agent interactions (e.g., generate draft → review code → deploy) manually.
- Lack of shared, version-controlled workflows leads to inconsistency and knowledge silos.
- Coordinating multi-step tasks across CLIs is error-prone and lacks observability.

Product Goals
-------------
- Allow users to define workflow manifests that orchestrate multiple agent steps with branching logic.
- Provide a CLI and UI that execute workflows locally or in CI with status tracking.
- Offer reusable templates and component library for common developer, DevOps, and data workflows.

Non-Goals
---------
- Building a full low-code automation SaaS; focus on developer-centric automation.
- Replacing existing CI/CD systems; instead integrate with them.
- Managing long-lived agents beyond workflow boundaries.

Personas
--------
- **Staff engineer:** Encapsulates best-practice agent sequences for the team.
- **Developer advocate:** Demonstrates multi-agent workflows in workshops.
- **Release manager:** Automates release readiness checks leveraging different AI tools.

User Stories
------------
1. As a staff engineer, I define `workflow.yaml` listing a design review prompt via Gemini followed by implementation help via Codex and automated testing via Copilot CLI.
2. As a release manager, I trigger a workflow that generates changelogs, runs policy checks with Cloud CLI, and posts status to Slack.
3. As a developer advocate, I publish a template gallery so others can fork and run curated workflows.

Functional Requirements
-----------------------
- Workflow manifest schema:
  - Steps referencing agent adapters and input payloads.
  - Conditional routing based on prior step outputs.
  - Shared context variables and secrets resolution.
  - Hooks for pre/post-processing scripts.
- Store CLI executables, manifest tooling, and template helpers under `scripts/workflow-composer/`, separating runner, validator, and template assets into obvious subdirectories.
- Execution engine:
  - Validates manifests, resolves dependencies, and orchestrates sequential or parallel steps.
  - Provides live progress reporting and failure recovery strategies (retry, skip, manual approval).
- Adapter layer leveraging existing CLI wrappers; support plugin discovery for additional agents.
- Artifact handling:
  - Capture outputs (text, files) per step.
  - Store artifacts locally or push to configured destinations (S3, Git repo, Slack webhook).
- Template ecosystem:
  - Bundle curated workflow templates.
  - Command to scaffold new workflows from template (`workflow-composer init`).
- Integration points:
  - GitHub Actions and other CI runners via lightweight wrapper action.
  - Optional TUI/HTML report summarizing workflow runs.

Non-Functional Requirements
---------------------------
- Deterministic execution with clear reproducibility controls.
- Configurable timeouts per step and overall workflow.
- Extensible plugin architecture with semantic versioning guarantees.
- Strong logging and audit trails for compliance.

Experience & Interaction
------------------------
- CLI commands: `workflow-composer run`, `validate`, `init`, `status`, `logs`.
- Rich textual progress bar showing current step, agent, elapsed time.
- Optional TUI dashboard for monitoring concurrent runs.
- Documentation site with schema reference and template gallery.

Success Metrics
---------------
- 70% of pilot workflows run end-to-end without manual intervention.
- Library of 20+ shared workflow templates adopted by teams within three months.
- 30% reduction in time to assemble multi-agent demos or release processes.

Milestones
----------
1. Manifest schema draft + validator + single-threaded executor (3 weeks).
2. Adapter plugins for core CLIs + artifact storage integration (4 weeks).
3. Template gallery and init scaffolding (2 weeks).
4. CI integrations, TUI dashboard, and documentation (3 weeks).

Risks & Mitigations
-------------------
- **Schema complexity:** Provide linting and strong validation errors to reduce onboarding friction.
- **Plugin drift:** Establish contract tests and version pinning for adapters.
- **Workflow debugging difficulty:** Offer replay mode and verbose logging toggles.

Dependencies
------------
- Access to downstream CLIs and authentication credentials.
- Storage backends for artifacts (local filesystem by default).
- Optional third-party service credentials (Slack, GitHub, etc.).

Open Questions
--------------
- Should workflows support human approval steps before continuing?
- How to package and share workflows securely across organizations?
- Should there be a hosted registry for templates and plugins?
